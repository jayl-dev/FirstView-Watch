# (Unofficial) FirstView Watch App

Simple watch app that I built for myself because the FirstView bus app doesn't have a watch client for android wear OS .


## Usage

To use, you will need to have a FirstView account created using the official app and login.

Each student is represented by a color generated using the student name. 
Clicking on the color buttons at the bottom of the screen will auto zoom the map view to the student.
